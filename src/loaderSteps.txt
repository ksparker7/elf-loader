the elf header contains all relevant informations to load an elf executable.

Steps an elf executable loader must perform

1. verify the file starts with the ELF magic number and subsequent table
2. Read the ELF header this is always at the beginning of an ELF file. 
    the header contains information on how the rest of the file is laid out
3. Read the elf executables program headers which specify
    where in the file the program segments are located and
    where they need to be loaded into memory
4. parse the program headers to determine the number of program segments that must be loaded
    each program header has an associated type. Only headers with a type of PT_LOAD 
    describe a loadable segment
5. Load each of the loadable segments. This is done as follows:
    a. allocate virtual memory for each segment, at the address specified by the p_vaddr
        member in the program header with size being p_memsz
    b. copy the segment data from the file offset specified by the p_offset member to the virtual
        memory address specified by the p_vaddr member. the size of the segment in the file
        is contained in the p_filesz member which can be zero.
    c. The p_memsz member specifies the size the segment occupies in memory. If the p-filesz and p_memsz 
        members differ then this indicates that the segment is padded with zeros. all bytes in memory
        between the ending offset of the file size and the segments virtual memory size are to be cleared with zeros
6. read the executables entry point from the ELF header
7. Jump to the executables entry point in the newly loaded memory
